## Data visualization - Crickets

Check out: Help-\>Cheat Sheets-\>Data Visualization with ggplot2

```{r}
#| message: false

We are examining cricket data.

```{r}
?crickets
view(crickets)
```

### First scatter plot

```{r}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate, color = species))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "Temperature",
       y = "Chirp rate",
       color = "Species",
       title = "Cricket chirps",
       caption = "Source: McDonald (2009)")+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```

Another version, this time color in geom. Change dot size, shape and transparency. Learn more with the ?geom_plot...

```{r}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate))+
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 5, alpha = 0.3, shape = "square")+
  labs(x = "Temperature",
       y = "Chirp rate",
       color = "Species",
       title = "Cricket chirps",
       caption = "Source: McDonald (2009)")
```

### Add another layer

You can add as many layers as you want.

```{r}
#| message: false
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  labs(x = "Temperature",
       y = "Chirp rate",
       color = "Species",
       title = "Cricket chirps",
       caption = "Source: McDonald (2009)")
```

Let's separate species:

```{r}
#| message: false
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate, color = species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
  labs(x = "Temperature",
       y = "Chirp rate",
       color = "Species",
       title = "Cricket chirps",
       caption = "Source: McDonald (2009)")
ggsave("images/test1.png")
```

### Histograms

One quantitative variable.

```{r}
#| message: false
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 15)
```

### Bars

```{r}
#| message: false
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = species))+
  geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "lightblue")
```

```{r}
#| message: false
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = species, fill = species))+
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE)+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```

### Frequency polygon

```{r}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate))+
  geom_freqpoly(bins = 15)
```

### Box plot

Representing 5 number summary.

```{r}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = species, y = rate))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = species, y = rate, color = species))+
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE)+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")+
  theme_minimal() #check ?theme_minimal
```

What plot to use depends, how many and what kind of variables you have. Generally avoid more than two variables in a single plot.

### Faceting

```{r}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate, fill = species))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~species)+ #wrap it by species
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```

```{r}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate, fill = species))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1)+ #wrap it by species
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```
