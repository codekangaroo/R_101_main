## Re install packages after R update.

### Before updating: !!!

```{r}
packages <- as.data.frame(installed.packages())
rownames(packages)
```

Next we create a txt file for the package names.

```{r}
out <- packages[, "Package"]
#head(out)
write.table(out, file = "Package_List.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE, 
            col.names = FALSE)

```

### Now is time to update the R and after update:

```{r}
List <- read.table("Package_List.txt")
head(List[,1])
```

And finally we can install all packages we had in previous version. When asked about "installing from sources that need compilation". Answer **NO**.

```{r}
install.packages(List[,1], repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
```
